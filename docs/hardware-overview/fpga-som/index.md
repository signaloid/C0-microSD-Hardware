# Using the Signaloid C0-microSD as a Hot-Pluggable FPGA System on Module (SoM)
When using the Signaloid C0-microSD as a hot-pluggable FPGA SoM, you can plug it into your computer, flash new FPGA bitstreams, and then either plug it into a breadboard using a microSD breakout board, or integrate it into a legacy (or custom) PCB that has an unused microSD slot. Once powered on, the built-in bootloader will check if the device has been connected to an SD host, and if not, will load the latest custom user bitstream. In this configuration, the C0-microSD offers six configurable I/O pins by repurposing the microSD pads, and five additional I/O pins in the form of test pads.

You can find example designs that use the on-board LEDs along with instructions on how to synthesize and load them to your device in the `rtl-examples/` directory of the [C0-microSD-Hardware](https://github.com/signaloid/C0-microSD-hardware) repository.

> Using the C0-microSD as a programmable FPGA SoM does not require switching between modes of operation. You only need to set your C0-microSD in **Bootloader** mode.
