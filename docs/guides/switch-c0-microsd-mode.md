# Switch between Operation Modes
You can use the `C0_microSD_toolkit.py`, which you can find [here](https://github.com/signaloid/C0-microSD-utilities), to switch between modes of operation.

1. Insert the C0-microSD into your computer.

2. Identify the C0-microSD device path. For this example, we assume the device path is `/dev/disk4`. You can find more details on how to identify your C0-microSD [here](/guides/identify-c0-microsd.html).

3. Verify the active mode. 
    - A solid red LED means that the C0-microSD is in Bootloader mode (Figure 1).
    - A solid green LED means that the C0-microSD is in Signaloid Soc mode (Figure 2).

4. Run `sudo python3 ./C0_microSD_toolkit.py -t /dev/disk4 -s` to switch operation mode. If this is successful, the opposite LED of the one that is solid should start blinking (Figures 3 and 4).

    Following is an example output of switching the operation mode of a C0-microSD from **Signaloid Soc** mode to **Bootloader** mode:

    ```
    % sudo python3 C0_microSD_toolkit.py -t /dev/disk4 -s

    Signaloid C0-microSD | Loaded configuration: Signaloid Soc | Version: 1.0 | State IDLE
    Switching device boot mode from Signaloid Soc to Bootloader...
    Device configured successfully. Power cycle the device to boot in new mode.
    Done.
    ```

5. Power-cycle the C0-microSD to load new configuration mode. This means that the LED that was previously flashing, should now be constantly on (Figures 5 and 6).

{: .note }
> In the visualizations above, the C0-microSD has been inserted into a common off-the-shelf microSD to SD adapter.

## Loading your custom user bitstream.
To use the Signaloid C0-microSD in **Custom User Bitstream** mode, you must first switch the device to **Bootloader** mode following the procedure above. After doing that, power it on without an SD-protocol host present. You can achieve that by powering it using a microSD breakout board, or by connecting it to the Signaloid SD-Dev and powering it from the PWR USB-C port.
